	/// For example, if your bundle contains files named `button.png`, `button@2x.png`, and `button.pdf` then `image(forResource: "button")` returns an `NSImage` object backed by all three files.
	/// Each time the `NSImage` object is drawn, it selects the representation best for the drawing context.
	///
	/// Images requested using this method whose name ends in the word `Template` are automatically marked as template images.
	///
	/// This method does not look up images based on
	/// [`setName(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/setname(_:))\

	/// Use
	/// [`init(named:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimage/init(named:))\
	/// for that purpose.
	///
	/// This method does not cache its search results.
	///
	/// - Parameter name: The name of the image resource file.
	/// - Returns: The `NSImage` object associated with the specified name, or `nil` if no file is found.
